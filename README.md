# Chatbot Integration with User-Specific Configuration
![Chatbot Integration](bot.jpg)

## Overview
This project allows web applications to integrate a chatbot that is personalized for each user. The chatbot's behavior and appearance can be customized via user-specific configurations, which are securely managed through a backend API. This documentation outlines how to embed the chatbot into a website, manage user configurations, and integrate the chatbot widget using an authentication system.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Supports token-based authentication using JWT/API keys.
- **User-Specific Bot Configuration**: Store and retrieve bot settings (like theme, greeting messages) for each user.
- **Frontend React Widget**: A React component that embeds the chatbot into a web application.
- **Backend API**: A FastAPI backend to manage bot configurations and handle requests securely.
- **Dynamic Chatbot Experience**: Load and display bot configurations based on the user's credentials.
